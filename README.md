Team Black-Dread | Digital Queue Management System

Description:

We are Team Black-Dread, and we present our project, Digital Queue Management System, designed to streamline queue handling by integrating services and automating workflows. This solution leverages Ballerina's powerful capabilities to efficiently manage and optimize customer flow, addressing the complexities of real-time queue management.

How We Used Ballerina:

Ballerina played a crucial role  in our project by providing robust API integration capabilities. We utilized the Ballerina /time module to implement time estimating functionality, allowing us to accurately calculate waiting times for customers in the queue. This streamlined our process and improved user experience, enabling us to efficiently manage customer interactions and enhance service delivery.
